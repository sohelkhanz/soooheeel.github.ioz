Design a class named Point which will model a 2D point with `X` and `Y` coordinates.

1. Two instance variable variables `X` \(`int`\) and `X` \(`int`\)
2. A "_no-argument_" \(or "_no-arg_"\) constructor that construct a point at `(0, 0)`.
3. A constructor that constructs a point with the given `x` and `y` coordinates.
4. Getter and setter for the instance variables `x` and y.
5. A method `setXY()` to set both x and y.
6. A `toString()` method that returns a string description of the instance in the format \`"\(x,

   y\)"\`.

7. A method called `distance(int x, int y)` that returns the distance from this point to

   another point at the given `(x, y)` coordinates.

8. An overloaded `distance(Point another)` that returns the distance from this point to

   the given `Point` instance another.

For example -

```java
package bd.com.howtocode.java;

/**

 */

public class Point {
    private int x;
    private int y;

    public Point() {
        x = 0;
        y = 0;
    }

    public Point(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    public int getX() {
        return x;
    }

    public void setX(int x) {
        this.x = x;
    }

    public int getY() {
        return y;
    }

    public void setY(int y) {
        this.y = y;
    }

    public double distance(int x, int y) {
        int xDiff = this.x - x;
        int yDiff = this.y - y;
        return Math.sqrt(xDiff * xDiff + yDiff * yDiff);
    }

    public double distance(Point p2) {
        return distance(p2.getX(), p2.getY());
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "(" + x + ", " + ")";
    }
}
```

Now write a program that allocates 10 points in an array of `Point`, and initializes to \(1, 1\), \(2, 2\), ... \(10, 10\).
